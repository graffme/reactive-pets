## About the project

This project was created as a recruitment task for React Native workshops and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application collects data from the user through a simple form and then displays the images downloaded from the api [shibe.online](https://shibe.online/).

To test the app go to [this page](https://graffme.github.io/reactive-pets/) and have fun watching cute pets! 🐶 🐱 🐦
